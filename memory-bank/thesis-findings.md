# Thesis Findings and Recommendations

## Findings

### 1. Technical and Infrastructure Barriers

**1.1 Server Performance Issues**
Our survey reveals widespread connectivity issues, with an overwhelming 88% of respondents reporting challenges in accessing these services. These infrastructure limitations create a foundational barrier affecting users across all digital literacy levels. Specifically, the BRTA portal experiences frequent server downtimes and slow response times, with 29.73% of users reporting pages taking too long to load. Similarly, the E-Passport portal's performance issues emerged as the most prevalent concern, with 82 respondents reporting slow loading times or errors. The Railway E-Ticketing platform faces similar challenges, especially during high-demand periods.

**1.2 Payment Processing Challenges**
Payment processing emerges as another significant technical barrier across all platforms. Users frequently report transaction failures, delayed confirmations, and complicated refund processes. For instance, the payment process is inefficient, with issues like delayed and unprocessed receipts despite successful transactions, missing cancellation mechanisms, and requiring physical visits to resolve such errors. Additionally, in cases where a wrong transaction ID is entered, the payment process is disqualified with no automated refund system, which creates stress and inconvenience for users.

**1.3 Poor System Integration**
Integration between different government databases also poses a technical challenge. For example, "I had trouble selecting an option because I have X data in a particular field in my NID and there was no X option in the E-Passport site." The research also found that NID doesn't have the address, father and mother's name in English while applying. No English option for parents' names and addresses. So cannot sync fully with the passport. This poor integration creates significant usability barriers for users.

**1.4 Mobile Responsiveness Issues**
Despite 97% of users owning smartphones and 53.7% preferring mobile access for railway ticketing, the platforms struggle to provide consistent mobile experiences. Users report interface elements not rendering properly on mobile screens and functionality limitations when accessing services through smartphones.

### 2. Interface and Navigation Complexities

**2.1 Confusing Navigation**
The BRTA portal faces significant interface challenges. Of the surveyed users, 27 individuals (representing 24.32%) reported difficulty finding information on the portal. Across all platforms, navigation complexities with a non-intuitive menu structure were identified. Essential functions like license applications and vehicle registrations are buried under multiple layers of navigation.

**2.2 Unclear Instructions and Guidance**
The complexity of instructions poses another substantial barrier, with 21 users (18.92%) indicating they struggled to understand and follow the portal's guidance. For the E-Passport service, 56 respondents reported unclear instructions and 45 users expressing confusion about application processes. This was emphasized by a user comment: "Website a ki ki mandatory, ki ki kora jabe na clear bola thake na, then office a hoyrani kore." (The website doesn't clearly state what is mandatory and what cannot be done, leading to harassment at the office.)

**2.3 Inadequate Error Handling**
The system lacks proper error prevention mechanisms - forms accept invalid data formats without real-time validation, leading to submission failures. Error messages are technical and cryptic, failing to guide users toward solutions. Additionally, a common thread across all platforms is the challenge of unclear error messages and insufficient user feedback. When users encounter problems, the interfaces often fail to provide clear guidance on how to resolve issues or proceed.

**2.4 Inconsistent Design Elements**
The interface uses inconsistent terminology between Bangla and English versions, creating confusion for users switching between languages. Furthermore, almost all of the interfaces also suffer from inconsistent visual hierarchy, making important information and actions difficult to identify. The Railway website, for example, uses technical terminology like "BST" (Bangladesh Standard Time) and military-style time formats (e.g., "1438min") instead of more user-friendly alternatives that match how people naturally think about time.

### 3. Security and Trust Issues

**3.1 Low Confidence in Data Security**
The survey findings reveal deep-seated concerns about security and data protection across Bangladesh's e-government platforms, significantly impacting user confidence and willingness to engage with these digital services. For example, the BRTA portal, security concerns emerge as a significant barrier to adoption, with only 10.3% of users expressing confidence in the portal's security. The majority (51.7%) reported low or no confidence in the security of their shared information.

**3.2 Payment Security Concerns**
Across all platforms, payment security emerges as a common concern. Users express particular anxiety about online transactions, leading many to prefer in-person payments despite the convenience of digital options. This anxiety is amplified by the unclear error messages during payment processing or lack of immediate transaction confirmation increase users' anxiety about the security of their financial information.

### 4. Limited Process Flexibility

**4.1 Lack of Editing Options After Submission**
They also mentioned usability and accessibility issues like the lack of the edit or cancel option. More specifically, "Once information is submitted, there is no way to correct it. You will have to go to the office and apply for cancellation, but there is no way to do it online." This lack of flexibility creates significant usability barriers, especially for users with limited digital literacy.

**4.2 No Rescheduling Options**
All mediators expressed their concerns about the absence of a rescheduling process, which prevents them from rescheduling their appointments before the scheduled date or after a missed appointment. As a result, users have to undergo the same application and payment process, which causes significant inconvenience to the users, creating frustration among them.

**4.3 Offline Dependencies**
the ownership transfer procedure is also hectic, with slow document uploads and manual approvals with an offline dependency that makes the process frustrating and time-consuming for users. Additionally, the website's offline dependency is also a crucial reason for mediator reliance, as tasks like ownership transfers need in-person visits, making it easier for the clients to rely on mediators.

### 5. Digital Literacy and Mediator Dependency

**5.1 High Reliance on Intermediaries**
Approximately 7% of BRTA service users reported requiring mediator assistance, while the figures stand at 11% for e-Passport services, 9% for NID services, and 6% for railway e-ticketing services. This number is even higher for users with lower digital literacy. This widespread dependence creates security concerns as users must share sensitive personal information with intermediaries to complete their transactions.

**5.2 Fear of Making Errors**
Several factors contribute to mediator dependency, including the "fear of errors" among users with limited digital literacy. As one administrator noted, "These issues will last as long as all the people are not used to using digital devices. They will have the fear of errors. So they take help from others, such as family members and mediators."

**5.3 Convenience Over Independence**
According to them, users prefer convenience and efficiency, which leads to mediator dependency. Mediators observed that "They usually take the service from us because they do not want to go through the hectic process. Even if the client knows how to use the website, they still want the luxury of not doing it themselves when they can pay us."

### 6. Usability Barriers for Specific User Groups

**6.1 Age-Related Challenges**
The research identified particular difficulties for elderly users, as noted by an administrator: "I have seen the elderly and people with limited education face most of the challenges."

**6.2 Educational Barriers**
The concentration of users with higher education (41% with bachelor's degrees, 21% with master's degrees) suggests that these services may be inadvertently designed for more educated users, potentially excluding those with limited formal education. This educational skew indicates a significant barrier for less educated citizens attempting to access these services.

**6.3 Language and Localization Issues**
The exclusive use of English, combined with occasionally complex terminology, creates accessibility barriers for users who may be more comfortable with Bangla or simpler English phrases. This violates the heuristic of matching the system to the user's language. Furthermore, there is no support for the local languages, like Bangla.

## Recommendations

### 1. Technical and System Enhancements

**1.1 Server Infrastructure Improvements**
Significant server capacity improvements are needed across all platforms to address downtime and slow performance issues. For the Railway E-Ticketing system in particular, better server capacity to handle peak loads, especially during high-demand times, is essential. As one respondent emphasized: "Server needs to be more speedy and secure," highlighting the fundamental nature of these improvements for user experience.

**1.2 Enhanced Database Integration**
Implementing better database synchronization would streamline processes and reduce the need for repeated data entry. There should be a seamless integration between NID, Passport, and other government databases to ensure data consistency and reduce errors. As suggested by the NID mediator, "NID should be provided after the SSC exam to make passport application easier," to optimize a future passport application and ensure more seamless digital identity management.

**1.3 Payment System Upgrades**
Payment systems across all platforms need significant upgrades. Users consistently report issues with transaction processing and refund mechanisms. Implementing more reliable payment gateways and automated refund processing would enhance user confidence in digital transactions. BRTA mediators specifically suggested "fixing payment procedures and introducing automated refund systems and instant receipt-generating systems."

**1.4 Improved Mobile Responsiveness**
With 97% of users owning smartphones and many preferring mobile access, the platforms must be optimized for mobile devices. BRTA administrators emphasized the need for a BSP mobile application, stating, "The organization is determined to conduct all the services fully online draw BSP portal. If there are any developed apps of the BSP portal to avail all the services in Android or iOS, it will be a great benefit as there are many differences between the BSP web version and app version."

**1.5 Enhanced Error Handling Systems**
Error handling systems need significant enhancement to provide more useful feedback to users. Current error messages often fail to guide users toward solutions, leading to frustration and increased dependence on external help. Implementing more informative error messages with clear resolution steps would empower users to solve problems independently.

### 2. User Interface and Navigation Improvements

**2.1 Simplified Navigation**
The interface should be redesigned with a simpler, more intuitive navigation structure. Design a clearly visible, logically organized navigation structure with breadcrumb navigation to show user location within the system. Essential functions should be easily accessible within minimal clicks.

**2.2 Clearer Instructions and Guidance**
Interactive guidance systems, such as live chat support, emerge as a highly requested feature. This would provide real-time assistance without requiring users to visit physical offices or rely on mediators. Mediators suggested enhancement of the Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) section and step-by-step visual guidelines that can assist users in understanding the website instructions.

**2.3 Enhanced Visual Design**
The visual design aspects of the portal received particularly critical feedback, with 29 users (41.4% of respondents) rating it as either "Below Average" or "Very Poor" in terms of layout and visual appeal. Improvements should include a consistent design language, better color contrast, and a clearer visual hierarchy to highlight important information and actions.

**2.4 Multilingual Support**
The need for multi-language support is evident, ensuring instructions are clear in both Bangla and English. This becomes particularly important for services like e-passports, where accurate information is crucial for international travel. Complete Bangla localization should be implemented across all platforms to make them more accessible to users who are not comfortable with English.

### 3. Process Simplification and Flexibility

**3.1 Online Editing and Cancellation Options**
BRTA mediators recommended newer features like online editing and a cancellation process, which will help users avoid the hassle of in-person visits to the BRTA offices. Similarly, the NID mediator revealed severe modification barriers and suggested the implementation of an online editing or cancellation feature to increase efficiency and reduce the hassle of in-person visits.

**3.2 Appointment Rescheduling Feature**
Passport mediators strongly recommended a rescheduling option, as users need to undergo the same application process if they somehow miss the appointment. This feature would significantly improve the user experience and reduce unnecessary repetition of processes.

**3.3 Reducing Offline Dependencies**
The biggest barrier to making the BRTA website accessible and user-friendly is the offline approval. It should be made fully online. Further, streamlined documentation requirements and more straightforward verification processes would reduce the need for in-person visits and mediator assistance.

### 4. Enhanced User Support and Education

**4.1 Comprehensive Help Resources**
Given that many users struggle to understand the system due to limited digital literacy, mediators advocated for visual content and live chats for better understanding and assistance. Video tutorials would help clients become more independent. The BRTA admins also emphasized "Features like step-by-step tutorials and simplified interfaces could significantly improve usability," indicating the importance of visual navigation guidance for this system.

**4.2 Context-Sensitive Help Features**
Context-sensitive help features are needed to provide immediate assistance at specific points in various processes. Users expressed frustration with having to search extensively for help with particular steps or requirements, suggesting the need for more intuitive support integration.

**4.3 Digital Literacy Programs**
BRTA administrators suggested a possible collaboration with non-governmental organizations like NGOs for BRTA and users, as they won't have to pay mediator fees for additional assistance. Such initiatives could help improve digital literacy among users and reduce dependency on mediators.

### 5. Security and Trust Enhancements

**5.1 Transparent Security Measures**
The findings suggest that addressing security concerns requires not just technical improvements but also better communication about security measures and data protection protocols. Users need more transparency about how their data is handled, stored, and protected across these government platforms. As suggested by the Passport administrators, "To build trust, we need more advertising and letting people know their data is safe."

**5.2 Secure but User-Friendly Authentication**
Implement more secure but usable authentication methods that protect user data without creating additional barriers for those with limited digital literacy. Implement visible security indicators to build user trust and create transparent data usage policies with user consent.

### 6. Mediator Support and Regulation

**6.1 Official Mediator Registration**
Mediators suggested implementing a mediator account system where they can have verified accounts to increase efficiency. One mediator said, "If BRTA gave us an official account that is registered then it would be very helpful for us so we can provide service to customers from our accounts and they will also be relieved that we are certified by BRTA." This would help regulate mediator services and protect users from exploitation.

**6.2 Mediator Training and Certification**
Develop training programs for mediators to ensure they follow best practices and maintain user privacy. Create a mediator portal with appropriate security and tracking, implement user permission controls for mediator assistance, and design transparent mediator verification and authorization.

### 7. Accessibility for Diverse User Groups

**7.1 Age-Friendly Design**
Implement design features that accommodate the needs of elderly users, including larger text options, simpler navigation, and more comprehensive help systems. Design interfaces that accommodate varying literacy levels and create pictorial guides with minimal text requirements.

**7.2 Accommodations for Various Educational Levels**
Develop a "basic mode" with simplified workflow for users with limited digital skills. This would make the platforms more accessible to users with varying educational backgrounds and digital proficiency levels.

These findings and recommendations highlight the critical challenges facing Bangladesh's e-government services and provide a comprehensive framework for improving usability, especially for users with limited digital literacy. By addressing technical infrastructure, user interface design, process flexibility, support systems, security concerns, mediator regulation, and accessibility, these platforms can better serve all citizens regardless of their digital skills.
