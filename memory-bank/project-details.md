# Project Requirements: Enhanced e-Passport Website Prototype

Based on your comprehensive research findings on usability challenges in Bangladesh's e-government websites, I've developed the following project requirements for an enhanced e-Passport prototype. This prototype will serve as a practical demonstration of your research recommendations, addressing the key issues identified in your thesis.

## 1. Technical Infrastructure Requirements

### 1.1 Server Performance

- Include visual server status indicators to inform users of current system performance
- Implement a queuing system during peak usage periods with transparent wait time indicators
- Create fallback mechanisms for when server demand exceeds capacity

### 1.2 Database Integration
- Develop a simulated NID database integration that automatically pre-fills user data
- Create API endpoints to retrieve user data using NID number and verification tokens
- Implement data validation that cross-references with the simulated NID database
- Design error handling procedures for database connectivity issues

### 1.3 Payment Processing
- Create a streamlined payment system with clear progress indicators
- Implement instant payment confirmation with downloadable receipts
- Build a simulated refund processing system for payment errors
- Include payment tracking and history for user reference

## 2. User Interface and Experience Requirements

### 2.1 Multilingual Support
- Develop fully functional Bangla and English interfaces with consistent terminology
- Ensure proper character rendering in both languages
- Implement language toggle with session persistence
- Provide consistent labels and instructions across languages

### 2.2 Navigation Enhancement
- Design a clearly visible, logically organized navigation structure
- Implement breadcrumb navigation to show user location within the system
- Create persistent access to frequently used functions
- Reduce navigation depth (no more than 3 clicks to reach any function)

### 2.3 Form Design
- Develop smart forms with inline validation and error prevention
- Implement automatic saving of form progress to prevent data loss
- Create logical form sections with clear progress indicators
- Provide contextual help for complex form fields

### 2.4 Visual Design
- Create a clean, uncluttered interface with appropriate white space
- Implement consistent color coding for different functions and messages
- Design for accessibility with adjustable text sizes and high contrast options
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all critical functions

## 3. User Support and Guidance Requirements

### 3.1 Help System
- Develop an interactive help system with context-sensitive guidance
- Create illustrated step-by-step tutorials for common tasks
- Implement tooltips for form fields and functions
- Design a searchable FAQ section with common issues and solutions

### 3.2 Error Handling
- Create user-friendly error messages with clear resolution steps
- Implement validation that prevents common errors before submission
- Provide visual cues for form fields with errors
- Design a system that maintains user progress when errors occur

### 3.3 Guided Walkthroughs
- Develop interactive walkthroughs for first-time users
- Create video tutorials with subtitles in both Bangla and English
- Implement a virtual assistant that guides users through complex processes
- Design a "simplified mode" for users with limited digital literacy

## 4. Process Improvement Requirements

### 4.1 Application Workflow
- Streamline the passport application process with clear status tracking
- Create a dashboard showing application progress and next steps
- Implement appointment scheduling with calendar integration
- Design a document upload system with clear specifications and examples

### 4.2 Data Correction Capabilities
- Develop an intuitive system for correcting application information after submission
- Create a simple process for rescheduling appointments
- Implement a mechanism for updating contact information without affecting the application
- Design a change request tracking system

### 4.3 Security Features
- Implement visible security indicators to build user trust
- Create transparent data usage policies with user consent
- Develop secure but usable authentication methods
- Design privacy controls that are easily understood by users with limited digital literacy

## 5. Digital Inclusion Requirements

### 5.1 Accessibility Features
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all website functions
- Implement screen reader compatibility for visually impaired users
- Create keyboard navigation for all functions
- Design for users with various motor and cognitive abilities

### 5.2 Digital Literacy Accommodation
- Develop a "basic mode" with simplified workflow for users with limited digital skills
- Create pictorial guides with minimal text requirements
- Implement voice guidance options for navigation
- Design interfaces that accommodate varying literacy levels

### 5.3 Mediator Support
- Create a mediator portal with appropriate security and tracking
- Implement user permission controls for mediator assistance
- Design transparent mediator verification and authorization
- Develop audit trails for mediator activities to prevent exploitation

## 6. Implementation Considerations

### 6.1 Development Approach
- Use a progressive enhancement approach to ensure basic functionality on all devices
- Implement responsive design principles for mobile, tablet, and desktop access
- Develop with open web standards for maximum compatibility
- Create modular components that can be reused across different e-government services

### 6.2 Testing Requirements
- Conduct usability testing with diverse user groups, particularly those with limited digital literacy
- Perform load testing to ensure performance under high demand
- Implement security testing to protect user data
- Design accessibility testing with assistive technology users

### 6.3 Documentation
- Create comprehensive technical documentation for the prototype
- Develop user guides in multiple formats (text, video, pictorial)
- Document all API integrations for future expansion
- Create a style guide for consistent implementation

## 7. Key Features to Highlight in the Prototype

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show how complex forms can be broken into manageable steps
3. **Multilingual Support**: Showcase seamless switching between Bangla and English
4. **Contextual Help**: Demonstrate context-sensitive guidance throughout the application process
5. **Error Prevention**: Show how smart validation prevents common submission errors
6. **Visual Status Tracking**: Highlight transparent application progress visualization
7. **Mediator Portal**: Demonstrate secure delegation for those needing assistance
8. **Mobile Optimization**: Show full functionality on mobile devices
9. **Simplified Mode**: Demonstrate the interface adapted for users with limited digital literacy

This prototype will serve as a practical demonstration of the recommendations from your research, showing how thoughtful design can address the usability challenges identified in your thesis while promoting digital inclusion for all citizens of Bangladesh.
